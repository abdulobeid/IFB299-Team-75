From the start I have been heavily involved in the stories for our project.

I took the initial stories during our meeting with our client team, of which MediaVaultStrories is a copy of my initial stories.

I also helped our initial designs to show our client. File Upload is my personal design. It was not favored by the client
but it was still done for them.

The release and sprint plan was created by Karim and myself. It is likely it will also turn up in his portfolio as we
both worked on it.

Finally the Sprint 1 and 2 Stories and Acceptance Critera for those stories was an area I did significant work on across
this project. They have been through a few revisions to have better critera (As the initial version was a bit scant)
